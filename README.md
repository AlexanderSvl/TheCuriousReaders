<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A small-town library called "The curious readers" requires building a brand new digital management system of their books' portfolio. The library currently manages its books and subscribers portfolio in an old-fashioned manner, entirely paper-based and requiring the customers' physical presence for subscriptions and reserving books. Based on extensive research of the business losses for the past few years, the library has realized that they need to embrace a digital transformation and build a modern system that will give the readers a better experience with their services and keep them in the business for the years to come.

## You can also search for a book.
As you can see on the photo the cover of the book is not available. This is because images are stored in blob storage. Unfortenately I don't have subscribtion to it anymore :(
